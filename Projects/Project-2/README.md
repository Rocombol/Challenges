# #Project-2: Focus-mapdot

**Project-2 Wrap-up #1**

*to be involved in a project, join #project-2 channel on slack*

* the idea is to learning js by building together a map that shows the "help" events in some way. maybe by capturing twitter hastags from its firehose API. ideally, that thing would go big. for now, let's start by just making it work.
* many ux/ui, that time, so we focused on how to represent the data on a google map
* a dropmark.com has been created so that different visuals can be overviewed, ask vincegreenfield or any other member to add you

*next steps* :
* drag more attention and set a first project, split in teams if there's enough participants
* a github folder will be created. we need someone to help wording the project in an appealing, easy to understand short text
